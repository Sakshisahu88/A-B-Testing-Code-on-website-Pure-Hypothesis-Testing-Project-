A/B Testing on Website Conversion (Hypothesis Testing Project)
Project Overview
This project focuses on A/B Testing to compare the conversion rates of two website versions (A and B) using Hypothesis Testing techniques.
The goal is to determine whether there is a statistically significant difference between the two versions.

 Objective
To analyze website conversion data and identify which version performs better using a Z-test for proportions.

Dataset
Source: Kaggle
Dataset: AB Testing Conversion Dataset

 Hypothesis
Null Hypothesis (H₀): There is no difference in conversion rates between version A and version B.
Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): There is a significant difference in conversion rates between version A and version B.
Statistical Test Used

Z-test for proportions
Significance level (α) = 0.05

Tools & Libraries
Python
Pandas
NumPy
SciPy
Matplotlib

Conclusion

Based on the p-value obtained from the Z-test, we conclude whether to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis, helping make data-driven decisions for website optimization.
